In this notebook we try to practice all the classification algorithms that we learned in this course.

We load a dataset using Pandas library, and apply the following algorithms, and find the best one for this specific dataset by accuracy evaluation methods.

Lets first load required libraries:

import itertools
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.ticker import NullFormatter
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.ticker as ticker
from sklearn import preprocessing
%matplotlib inline
About dataset
This dataset is about past loans. The Loan_train.csv data set includes details of 346 customers whose loan are already paid off or defaulted. It includes following fields:

Field	Description
Loan_status	Whether a loan is paid off on in collection
Principal	Basic principal loan amount at the
Terms	Origination terms which can be weekly (7 days), biweekly, and monthly payoff schedule
Effective_date	When the loan got originated and took effects
Due_date	Since it’s one-time payoff schedule, each loan has one single due date
Age	Age of applicant
Education	Education of applicant
Gender	The gender of applicant
Lets download the dataset

Data visualization and pre-processing
Let’s see how many of each class is in our data set

In [6]:
df['loan_status'].value_counts()
Out[6]:
PAIDOFF       260
COLLECTION     86
Name: loan_status, dtype: int64
260 people have paid off the loan on time while 86 have gone into collection

Lets plot some columns to underestand data better:

In [7]:
# notice: installing seaborn might takes a few minutes
!conda install -c anaconda seaborn -y
Solving environment: done

# All requested packages already installed.

In [8]:
import seaborn as sns

bins = np.linspace(df.Principal.min(), df.Principal.max(), 10)
g = sns.FacetGrid(df, col="Gender", hue="loan_status", palette="Set1", col_wrap=2)
g.map(plt.hist, 'Principal', bins=bins, ec="k")

g.axes[-1].legend()
plt.show()

In [9]:
bins = np.linspace(df.age.min(), df.age.max(), 10)
g = sns.FacetGrid(df, col="Gender", hue="loan_status", palette="Set1", col_wrap=2)
g.map(plt.hist, 'age', bins=bins, ec="k")

g.axes[-1].legend()
plt.show()

Pre-processing: Feature selection/extraction
Lets look at the day of the week people get the loan
In [10]:
df['dayofweek'] = df['effective_date'].dt.dayofweek
bins = np.linspace(df.dayofweek.min(), df.dayofweek.max(), 10)
g = sns.FacetGrid(df, col="Gender", hue="loan_status", palette="Set1", col_wrap=2)
g.map(plt.hist, 'dayofweek', bins=bins, ec="k")
g.axes[-1].legend()
plt.show()

We see that people who get the loan at the end of the week dont pay it off, so lets use Feature binarization to set a threshold values less then day 4

In [11]:
df['weekend'] = df['dayofweek'].apply(lambda x: 1 if (x>3)  else 0)
df.head()
Out[11]:

Convert Categorical features to numerical values
Lets look at gender:

In [12]:
df.groupby(['Gender'])['loan_status'].value_counts(normalize=True)
Out[12]:
Gender  loan_status
female  PAIDOFF        0.865385
        COLLECTION     0.134615
male    PAIDOFF        0.731293
        COLLECTION     0.268707
Name: loan_status, dtype: float64
86 % of female pay there loans while only 73 % of males pay there loan

Lets convert male to 0 and female to 1:

In [13]:
df['Gender'].replace(to_replace=['male','female'], value=[0,1],inplace=True)
df.head()
Out[13]:
Unnamed: 0	Unnamed: 0.1	loan_status	Principal	terms	effective_date	due_date	age	education	Gender	dayofweek	weekend

Classification
Now, it is your turn, use the training set to build an accurate model. Then use the test set to report the accuracy of the model You should use the following algorithm:

K Nearest Neighbor(KNN)
Decision Tree
Support Vector Machine
Logistic Regression
Notice:

You can go above and change the pre-processing, feature selection, feature-extraction, and so on, to make a better model.
You should use either scikit-learn, Scipy or Numpy libraries for developing the classification algorithms.
You should include the code of the algorithm in the following cells.
K Nearest Neighbor(KNN)
Notice: You should find the best k to build the model with the best accuracy.
warning: You should not use the loan_test.csv for finding the best k, however, you can split your train_loan.csv into train and test to find the best k.
